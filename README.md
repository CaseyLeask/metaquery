# metaquery

A declarative breakpoint syntax. Defined in <meta>

## Getting Started

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/benschwarz/metaquery/master/metaquery.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/benschwarz/metaquery/master/metaquery.js

In your markup:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta name="breakpoint" data="phone" media="(max-width: 480px)">
        <meta name="breakpoint" data="small-tablet" media="(min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 600px)">
        <meta name="breakpoint" data="tablet" media="(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1024px)">
        <meta name="breakpoint" data="widescreen" media="(min-width: 1024px)">
  
        <style>
          .breakpoint-phone { background: red; }
          .breakpoint-small-tablet { background: green; }
          .breakpoint-tablet { background: blue; }
          .breakpoint-widescreen { background: yellow; }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <img src="./images/small.jpg" data-breakpoint-template="./images/{{breakpoint}}.jpg">
      </body>
      <script src="./metaquery.js"></script>
    </html>

Now you'll have access to the breakpoints that you've defined in three places:

* Via the CSS classes .breakpoint-<name-of-breakpoint> (shorter than media queries, no repeating yourself)
* Via responsive image tags (use the declarative interface for defining a convention, then build with that)
* Bind additional events in Javascript by inspecting the `MediaQueryList` objects via the `metaQuery.breakpoints` hash

# Browser support / Older browsers

## Note: These aren't going to work until I figure out addListener support for matchMedia.js

* ~~IE < 8 doesn't support media queries. Considering using [respond.js][respond.js]~~
* ~~Add the [matchMedia][matchMedia.js] polyfill for < Chrome 10, Firefox 6, Safari 5.1~~

## Backstory

I worked on a large HTML magazine that is edited by an editorial team. Each 'module' of a template is responsive, and requires unique styles and sometimes even scripts. After reflecting on the project for some time, what worked, what didn't I made some simple observations: 

* Writing media queries over and over again sucks. (Even though I used [the technique][responsive-design-with-sass] that I illustrated back in December 11')
* If you want media query access in javascript, you'll create another media query with `matchMedia`
* [picturefill][picturefill] is the best responsive image technique I've seenâ€¦ until I authored templates for a massive magazine. The syntax is too long and easy to forget. 
* and finally, a summary of all three: a declarative interface is far nicer to use.

After reading [Matt Wilcox's article], and the source of [picturefill][picturefill]
